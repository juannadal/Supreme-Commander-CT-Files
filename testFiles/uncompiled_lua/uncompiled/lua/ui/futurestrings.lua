-- The purpose of this file is to add strings that will be needed at some point, but the script isn't ready for the strings
-- This will allow the strings to be added to the loc table so localization can be done. When you're ready to use the
-- string, please copy it along with the loc tags (these must stay the same as they are here!) in to your script.
-- All the strings are placed in a comment so they will be picked up by the localizer tool, and no one will accidentally reference this file
